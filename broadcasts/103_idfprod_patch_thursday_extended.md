We are in the process of a migration of user home spaces to a new storage type for a better experience. 

But! Lots of you have been very busy apparently, and so our disk incremental copy is taking forever.

When this message disappears, that will be your good news.
Meanwhile services that allow you to modify your home space (notebooks, WebDAV) have to remain offline.
Sorry again.
