During today's [Patch Thursday](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/life/patch-thursday.html) maintenance period, user home spaces will be unavailable while we perform a migration to a new volume type. 

Services that access a user's home space (notebook, WebDAV) will be unavailable during this time.

Sorry for the disruption!
