LATEST UPDATE: our colleagues at SLAC report that on-going system recovery is taking longer than predicted. Our continued apologies to all users 😩 We are uncertain of the ETA at this time. 

Original notice:

Due to electrical work at Rubin's US Data Facility at SLAC, most Rubin data will be unavailable on 2025-07-07 from 04:00 Pacific (11:00 UTC), with service restored around ~21:00 Pacific (17 hours later)~ 

This means a severe degradation of data.lsst.cloud usability for which we are very sorry.
