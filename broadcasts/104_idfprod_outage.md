Due to electrical work at Rubin's US Data Facility at SLAC, most Rubin data will be unavailable on 2025-07-07 all day, with service restored around 21:00 Pacific.  

This means a severe degradation of data.lsst.cloud usability for which we are very sorry. 
Read [this page](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/hybrid.html) to understand what you can and cannot do while SLAC is offline.
