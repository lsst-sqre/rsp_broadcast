We're going to roll out a fix for the Job Monitor without waiting for the normal maintenance window.
Look what can we say? We can't watch you suffer when we have them fixes ready to go. Blame our poor impulse control. 

You can continue using the platform but please don't file bugs for anything that happens while this banner is up, just like [Patch Thursday](https://rsp.lsst.io/guides/life/patch-thursday.html)
